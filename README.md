# Discord_FilmBot

Let's say you have a movie night with friends. What better way to organize what movie 
to watch than to have a free-for-all random movie picker? FilmBot generates a list 
through certain commands within a server, and allows you and your friends to choose 
their favorite movies they want to watch, and have the bot choose a random one just
in time for movie night!

Features:
- Create a list of movies
- View and edit the list
- Research movies you want to watch
- Choose a random movie!
- Clear the list (admin only)
- Kick a member who doesn't agree with your taste in movies (Coming Soon!)

Setup:
Clone the repo and follow the rest of the steps to set up the bot.

--Disclaimer--
The Bot uses a database of the same name each time it creates a list.
If you see movies you don't recognize, clear the list. The update will
come in a few weeks, maybe don't use it until then.
